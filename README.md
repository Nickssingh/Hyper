# XGBoost Hyperparamter Tuning - Churn Prediction

## A. Goal
XGBoost is an effective machine learning algorithm; it outperforms many other algorithms in terms of both speed and efficiency. The implementation of XGBoost requires inputs for a number of different parameters. To completely harness the model, we need to tune its parameters. We will list some of the important parameters and tune our model.
